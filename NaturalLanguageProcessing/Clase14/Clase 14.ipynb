      "a kite is traditionally a tethered heavier-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag. a kite consists of wings, tethers, and anchors. kites often have a bridle to guide the face of the kite at the correct angle so the wind can lift it. a kite's wing also may be so designed so a bridle is not needed; when kiting a sailplane for launch, the tether meets the wing at a single point. a kite may have fixed or moving anchors. untraditionally in technical kiting, a kite consists of tether-set-coupled wing sets; even in technical kiting, though, a wing in the system is still often called the kite.\n",
      "\n",
      "the lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air flows around the kite's surface, producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings. the interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind. the resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of one or more of the lines or tethers to which the kite is attached. the anchor point of the kite line may be static or moving (e.g., the towing of a kite by a running person, boat, free-falling anchors as in paragliders and fugitive parakites or vehicle).\n",
